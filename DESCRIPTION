Title: Hypothesis Tests for Spatial Transcriptomics Data
Version: 0.98.0
Date: 2020-04-27
Description:
    Implements some basic hypothesis tests for spatial (transcriptomics) data,
    mostly related to spatial association with gene expression or regression
    with respect to simple gradients. These functions can be considered to be
    matrix-aware and SummarizedExperiment-compatible equivalents to
    counterparts in other packages like spdep.
